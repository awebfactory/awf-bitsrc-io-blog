**The best tutorial to get started, really, might be directly to `rtfm`
([Deno Docs - Getting Started](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started/create-a-project))**

But this article attracts me as being written by someone experienced that
understands the Deno and Fresh philosophy, and includes a very cool approach to
managing markdown (one of our real needs since it does not come native with
Fresh, as it does with some other frameworks (like
[Astro](https://astro.build/)))

So in this repo, we're following the bitsrc article, with atomic commits
